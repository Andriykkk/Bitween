[ ] add evaluation before and after quantisation
[ ] add outliers to separate matrix
[ ] some matrices could be quantised with 1.58 bits 
[ ] add quantisation to 1 bit and perform with two 1 bit linear layers addition using bits functions instead of transforming back to 16bit(look at the pytorch graph for this)
