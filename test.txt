● Plan: Adaptive Progressive Quantization System

  Core Architecture

  1. Quality-Driven Quantization Pipeline

  8-bit → quality check → 4-bit → quality check → 2-bit
                  ↓                      ↓           ↓
             pass/fail?            pass/fail?   pass/fail?
                  ↓                      ↓           ↓
             continue             layer-level   group size
                                  analysis     adaptation

  2. Adaptive Training with Sample Size Prediction

  Yes, it's absolutely possible! Train on small sample (128) and extrapolate:

  - Early stopping predictor: Monitor loss curve on 128 samples
  - Convergence detection: If loss plateaus by sample 128, predict final loss at 1000+
  - Training time estimation: loss_rate = (loss_100 - loss_128) / 28 → predict loss_1000
  - Decision threshold: If predicted loss > threshold, stop early and move to fallback

  3. Implementation Strategy

  Phase 1: Progressive Block Quantization

  class AdaptiveQuantizer:
      def __init__(self, quality_thresholds, memory_target):
          self.thresholds = quality_thresholds  # {perplexity: 1.05, kl_div: 0.1}
          self.memory_target = memory_target

      def quantize_progressively(self, model):
          for block in blocks:
              for bits in [8, 4, 2]:
                  # Try quantization
                  # Quick quality check (small sample)
                  # Decide: continue/fallback/layer-analysis

  Phase 2: Smart Training Control

  class AdaptiveTrainer:
      def train_with_prediction(self, block, samples_small=128, samples_full=1000):
          # Train on small sample
          loss_curve = train_incremental(block, samples_small)

          # Predict convergence
          if will_converge(loss_curve, target_loss):
              continue_training(samples_full - samples_small)
          else:
              return "early_stop"  # Save time, try different approach

  Phase 3: Layer Sensitivity Analysis

  def analyze_layer_sensitivity(block, threshold):
      layer_impacts = {}
      for layer in block.linear_layers:
          # Quantize only this layer, measure impact
          impact = measure_quality_impact(layer)
          layer_impacts[layer] = impact

      # Rank by sensitivity: most sensitive stays high precision
      return sorted(layer_impacts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

  Phase 4: Group Size Optimization

  def optimize_group_size(layer, memory_budget):
      for group_size in [32, 64, 128, 256]:
          memory_usage = calculate_memory(layer, group_size)
          if memory_usage <= memory_budget:
              quality = test_quality(layer, group_size)
              if quality <= threshold:
                  return group_size
      return None  # Can't fit in memory budget

  Benefits of This Approach

  1. Intelligent resource allocation - spend training time only where it matters
  2. Predictive training - avoid wasting compute on hopeless cases
  3. Fine-grained control - layer-level precision decisions
  4. Memory-first optimization - achieves target memory with minimal quality loss
  5. Practical deployment - real-world memory constraints drive decisions

  The sample size prediction is particularly clever - you can probably predict convergence behavior from the first 10-20% of training samples, saving 80% of training time on blocks that won't meet thresholds anyway.
